SteemCollage is a web app that displays new Steem stories by their images. As stories (with images) are added, they are inserted at the top of the collage. You can hover over any image to get a summary of the story, and click on the image to open the story in Steemit, in a new window. At the moment, the page updates every 3 minutes.

To watch all new Steem stories, enter: http://steemcollage.github.io

To watch new stories for a particular category, enter: http://steemcollage.github.io?cat=[cat] For example, http://steemcollage.github.io?cat=steemit.

The software uses SteemJS by @Fabien.
